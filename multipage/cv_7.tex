\section{Partial Projects List}


\cventry{10/2016--Present}{Open Repository of Social-Justice-Focused Senior Design Project Proposals for CS \& ECE}{Hani Awni}{}{}{
	Undergraduate engineering education currently fails to grow the requisite critical thinking, reflection, and theory necessary to facilitate socially-conscious project definition, even among those students inclined to address societal ills rather than 'sexy' tech capabilities. This ever-growing repository of example project proposals tackling issues of social justice provides realistic, undeniably-implementable technical proposals addressing problems commonly deemed a-priori a "social problem" by the tech community. Project proposals are intended to encourage design thinking, empower budding engineers to tackle classically 'off-limits' problems like online harassment, doxxing, or astroturfing, and demonstrate to the existing technical community how reasonably addressable these problems are in reality.
}
\cvitem{Status}{Ongoing. Accumulating project proposals \& establishing collaborations with UIUC ECE and CS departments.}

\cventry{01/2017--Present}{'Twelve Thousand Years of STEM' Display}{Hani Awni \& Cheyenne Syring}{}{}{
	Challenges eurocentric narratives of science, technology, and engineering that purport science "began in the Age of Enlightenment" by highlighting the multitudes of non-western pre-existing or ongoing scientific and technological developments across many domains of science and engineering. Will take the form of multiple-poster display situated in a highly-visible semi-permanent installation directly outside of the main Engineering Department advising center in UIUC's Engineering Hall .
}
\cvitem{Status}{Ongoing. Research and poster design underway.}

\cventry{10/2016--Present}{Toward a Feminist Social Network}{Hani Awni \& Online Collaborators}{}{}{
	Helping steer an in-development open-source twitter competitor, known as Mastodon, toward prioritizing tools for facilitating healthy interaction between users by providing code reviews, feature requests, and sparking community dialogue with the dominant devs. Coordinating with like-minded community members in moderation, feature design, and performing causal analysis of how the technology and the dominant social expectations might be tuned or reconcieved around the needs of activists and community organizers.
}
\cvitem{Status}{Ongoing. Current focus is addressing good faith microagressions while facilitating both unlearning toxicity \& expression of the oppressed.}

\cventry{04/2014--Present}{Automating Around Undesired Mental Illness Symptoms}{Hani Awni}{}{}{
	Circumvents numerous unwanted symptoms of mental illness, including impaired executive functioning due to depression and ADHD, difficulty initiating day due to depression, difficulty maintaining social bonds, and difficulty forming narratives of personal productivity in the form of a digital personal assistant allowing hierarchical project definition \& tracking inspired by GSD productivity methodology. Semiautomatically reduces entire library of tasks consituting projects, in light of current priorities and available time and context, into current task for immediate execution while forcing focus.
}
\cvitem{Status}{Ongoing. Basic project/task tracking implemented, currently implementing automation.}

\cventry{01/2016--05/2016}{Analogical Reasoning May Explain Racists Calling Idris Alba ``Too Street''}{Hani Awni, S. Wilner (Advisor), Dr. J. Hummel (PI)}{}{}{
	Demonstrates that pure analogical reasoning, as implemented in LISA, a neural-network model of human abstract relational reasoning, is sufficient to cause disbelief in a hypothetical African-American Bond after exposure to numerous extant James Bond film plots. Second phase demonstrates how even small amounts of minority representation both prevent such disbelief to reexposure and facilitate positive reactions to minority representation along new dimensions of identity.
}
\cvitem{Status}{Paused. Starved for time while translating additional Bond plots into propositional logic.}

\cventry{08/2015 - 12/2015}{Low Cost MicroUAVs: Off-the-Shelf Remote-Control Beetles}{Hani Awni}{}{}{
	Adapts the Maharbiz lab's work with Jade Flowering beetles as RC UAVs to work with off-the-shelf microcontrollers and radios. Uses ATTiny microcontroller and HM11 BLE module to substantially reduce electronics cost to less than $\$0.25$ per beetle by scaling up the beetle to carry the heavier payload. Needs Hercules, Atlas, or Goliath beetles or similar.
}
\cvitem{Status}{Paused. Electronics/Firmware complete, yet testing delayed pending access to large beetles and lab. Will resume if I ever live in Southeast Asia.}
